# Runoregi

[Runoregi](https://runoregi.rahtiapp.fi) is the Web front-end for verse
and poem similarity calculations on Finnic oral folk poetry.

## Setup

Python dependencies can be installed with the usual command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

As Runoregi is a front-end, it requires access to a MySQL database
containing all the data (poem texts, metadata, similarities etc.) in
order to work. The access is configured by the following environment
variables:
* `DB_HOST` -- hostname,
* `DB_PORT` -- port (must be given even if it's the default `3306`),
* `DB_USER` -- username,
* `DB_PASS` -- password,
* `DB_NAME` -- name of the database.

A dump of the database, including SQL scripts to load the tables, is
available in
[hsci-r/filter-db](https://github.com/hsci-r/filter-db) (currently
not public).

In addition to the database access, the following further environment
variables can be configured:
* `ENABLE_LOGGING_TO_DB` -- if set (to any value), Runoregi will write information about the requested pages and their loading times to the table `runoregi_log`,
* `VISUALIZATIONS_URL` -- the base URL of the [visualizations application](https://filter-visualizations.rahtiapp.fi) -- needed for the links to the visualizations (maps, type treemaps)!

## Running

For all the commands listed below, remember to set the environment
variables (see above).

### Local testing

The easiest way to run Runoregi for quick testing (e.g. if you're working
with the code) is to run:
```
python3 wsgi.py
```

The interface will be available for local connections under `localhost:5000`.

### Running with Gunicorn

To run Runoregi on a server and access it through the default HTTP port,
it should be enough to run:
```
gunicorn wsgi
```

See [Gunicorn documentation](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/run.html)
for more options.

### Deployment on Rahti

In our project Runoregi is hosted on the CSC's [Rahti](https://rahti.csc.fi/)
service, with a Docker image built using
[Source-to-image](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build).
For deployment, you need to link to this repository, provide a pull secret
(as long as the repository is private) and set the environment variables
to access the database.

Docker images for deployment on an own platform might be provided
in the future if needed.

## License

Right now this is a private repository and the code is not meant to be
used outside of the FILTER project. An open-source release is planned
as soon as possible.

## Publications

There are no publications so far descibing specifically the front-end.
